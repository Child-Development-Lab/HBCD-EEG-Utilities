## Download EEG data from Lasso 

Please see the central [HBCD Data Release Docs](https://hbcd-docs.readthedocs.io/data_access/) for instructions to access and download HBCD data.

When downloading EEG data from Lasso, ensure you download the ``scans.tsv`` file from the "Raw Data" tab of the File transfer interface. This file is necessary to run HBCD_EEG_Utilities.m 

## Running the script 

1. Open `HBCD-EEG-Utilities.m` and pres the green 'Run' button on the toolbar. 

2. Follow the prompts to select the data filepath, EEGLAB path, desired tasks, and output location. 

3. Wait for the script to finish. This could take up to 2 hours if processing all tasks for all release subjects. 

4. Find output in the output location you selected.
