# HBCD EEG Utilities

The [HBCD EEG Utilities](https://github.com/Child-Development-Lab/HBCD-EEG-Utilities) repository contains a MATLAB script that computes EEG derivatives from EEG .set files released as part of HBCD.

`script_name.m` computes EEG derivatives for the FACE, MMN, VEP, and RS tasks for HBCD EEG data and writes the output to .csv files.
