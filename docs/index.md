# HBCD EEG Utilities

The [HBCD EEG Utilities](https://github.com/Child-Development-Lab/HBCD-EEG-Utilities) repository contains `HBCD-EEG-Utilities.m`, a MATLAB script that computes EEG derivatives from HBCD EEG .set files and writes the output to .csv files. 

This script is designed for users of HBCD EEG data who wish to use derivatives developed by the EEG Working Group. See [Derivatives and ERP Specifications](https://childdevlab-hbcd-eeg-utilities.readthedocs.io/en/latest/derivatives_ERPspecs/) for a description of outputs.
