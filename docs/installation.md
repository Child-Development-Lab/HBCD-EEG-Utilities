# Installation

Users will need MATLAB and EEGLAB to run these scripts. Below are instructions for downloading these interfaces. 

You will need to check if your institution provides MATLAB licenses. If so, you can use your institution log in to set up a MATLAB account. If your institution does not provide MATLAB licenses, you will need to purchase one to install MATLAB.

### Install MATLAB: 

1. Download MATLAB [here](https://www.mathworks.com/help/install/ug/install-products-with-internet-connection.html) 
2. Select installation link appropriate to your operating system.
3. When you click on the installation link for your device, you will be prompted to sign in to your MATLAB account. If you have an existing MATLAB account, use your existing log in information. If this is your first time using MATLAB, select the “create account” button on the bottom left.
4. Once you have signed in, select the “download MATLAB” button. HBCD EEG Utilities scripts will work with any version of MATLAB. MATLAB will recommend you the most updated version of the program. We recommend using the version they recommend.
5. The executable for MATLAB will appear in your computer’s downloads folder. Double click the executable file to launch it.
6. The executable file will run and then prompt you to allow this program to make changes to your device. Click the “yes” button to proceed
7. Once you log in, the licensing agreement will appear. You will need to select the “yes” button to agree with the license and the “next” button to begin using MATLAB.
8. Use the “next” button to proceed through the “license” and “destination” pages
9. On the “products” page, check the boxes next to the signal processing toolbox and statistics and machine learning toolbox. The EEG core also recommends selecting the parallel processing toolbox. The click the “next” button
10. On the next page, select the “begin install” button
11. MATLAB will then be installed. You can monitor the progress of the installation on your screen or take a quick coffee break. It will take a few minutes to complete.
12. Once the installation is complete, select the “close” button
13. You now have MATLAB installed on your device!

### Install EEGLAB:

1. Download EEGLAB [here](https://sccn.ucsd.edu/eeglab/download.php)
2. Unlike MATLAB, you do not need a license to install EEGLAB. You will need to fill out the form using your name and institution email, and agree to their terms. Then select the submit button.
3. Select the first link that says (“click here”) on the Download EEGLAB page.
4. The installer for EEGLAB will appear in your computer’s “downloads” folder. Right click on this folder and select “extract all” then select “extract” from the following page.
5. You will now see the installation folder unzipping on your screen. This may take a few minutes to finish.
6. You will now have an unzipped folder containing the most recent version of EEGLAB. 
7. You may want to move this out of your “downloads” folder and into another location where you can easily find it. You can do this by right clicking on the folder and selecting “copy”. Then, open the folder you would like to move it to and select “paste”

## Download GitHub Repository
Now that you have the required software, you can run the HBCD-EEG-Utilities script to compute and save the derivatives. First, you will need to download the repository to your local computer. This can be done in a number of ways, but for a first time user we recommend downloading as a zip file. 

1. Click [here](https://github.com/Child-Development-Lab/HBCD-EEG-Utilities/tree/mainScroll) to access the repository. 
2. Select the green "Code <>" button at the top right. 
3. From the dropdown menu, select "Download ZIP" at the bottom. This will download the entire repository to your downloads folder. 
4. Navigate to your downloads folder. Select the zipped "HBCD-EEG-Utilities" folder by left clicking. Right click. 
5. Select the "Extract all" option from the drop down menu. This will unzip the repository to your downloads folder.
